## About

Welcome to the first of what we hope is many [Nix](https://nixos.org) community events at DEF CON. The [Southern California Nix User Group](https://socal-nug.com) presents **Nix Vegas** #1, also known as **Viva Nix Vegas**!

**Everyone is welcome regardless of identity, background, or experience level!** If you're a newbie or Nix expert or anything in between, come to the Nix Community to expand your knowledge of repeatably deployable software. Learn from the experts, and take your newfound knowledge back to your hobby or career and be able to teach others.

Nix Vegas is colocated with DEF CON 33, and we are in our first year as a DEF CON Community. The Las Vegas Convention Center kind of looks like a lambda (&lambda;), and we'll be located toward the upper right of the tip of the lambda (right [around here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5qEAZzSZ6pMUzyPu8)).
