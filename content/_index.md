## Rebuild The World

_With Nix, you don't even have to imagine that you can build the digital commons from scratch. One change to the [bootstrap](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/stdenv/linux/stdenv-bootstrap-tools.nix), and you'll rebuild the world. But, it's your world, and you can see every leaf and branch of the [Great Tree](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/) in front of you._

In a world full of unwanted app updates and SaaS providers who want your personal information, being able to self host one of the [largest](https://search.nixos.org/packages) collections of software on the planet in a stable way across updates with NixOS has the potential to change the game for anyone who's tired of the slow decline of cloud services. With a single line of code, you can enable replacements for services as varied as [Google Photos](https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=25.05&show=services.immich.enable&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=immich) or [Slack](https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=25.05&show=services.mattermost.enable&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=mattermost), and deploy them repeatably across as many machines as you want.

Even if you don't run NixOS, building software with Nix allows you to deploy it across different Linux distributions and architectures. No longer do you have to build entire distributions into Docker images or flatpaks that bitrot - Nix [can do that too](https://ryantm.github.io/nixpkgs/builders/images/dockertools/), and it can do it over and over again. Set up a development shell to provide friends or coworkers access to dev environments, and build your software the same way every time, with upwards of 120,000 packages you can leverage.

Access to services and software everywhere: that's Nix. We've come a long way since Eelco Dolstra's 2006 [PhD thesis](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf). Welcome to Nix Vegas, where we want to rebuild the world.

## About

Nix Vegas is the first [Nix](https://nixos.org) community event at DEF CON, presented by the [Southern California Nix User Group](https://socal-nug.com) and Distractions, Inc.

If you're a newbie or Nix expert or anything in between, or even if you're interested in other functional deployment technologies like Guix, come to the Nix Community to expand your knowledge of repeatably deployable software. Learn from the experts, and take your newfound knowledge back to your hobby or career and be able to teach others.

Nix Vegas is colocated with DEF CON 33, and we are in our first year as a DEF CON Community. Everyone is welcome regardless of identity, background, or experience level. The Las Vegas Convention Center kind of looks like a lambda (&lambda;), and we'll be located toward the upper right of the tip of the lambda (right [around here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5qEAZzSZ6pMUzyPu8)).
