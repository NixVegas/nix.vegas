## About

Nix Vegas is the first [Nix](https://nixos.org) community event at DEF CON, presented by the [Southern California Nix User Group](https://socal-nug.com) and Distractions, Inc.

If you're a newbie or Nix expert or anything in between, or even if you're interested in other functional deployment technologies like Guix, come to the Nix Community to expand your knowledge of repeatably deployable software. Learn from the experts, and take your newfound knowledge back to your hobby or career and be able to teach others.

Nix Vegas is colocated with DEF CON 33, and we are in our first year as a DEF CON Community. Everyone is welcome regardless of identity, background, or experience level. The Las Vegas Convention Center kind of looks like a lambda (&lambda;), and we'll be located toward the upper right of the tip of the lambda (right [around here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5qEAZzSZ6pMUzyPu8)).
