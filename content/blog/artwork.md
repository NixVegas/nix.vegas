## Theme

Our theme this year is **Rebuild the World**, and it shows in our artwork
of the World Tree [Yggdrasil](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Yggdrasill):

- The branches and leaves representing the thousands of packages in
  [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs);
- The roots. (Are they [GC
  roots](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.18/package-management/garbage-collector-roots)
  or [roots of
  trust](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-25.05/nixos/modules/config/nix.nix#L449))?
- The dragon
  [Níðhögg](https://norse-mythology.org/gods-and-creatures/giants/nidhogg/)
  coveting the [Flake](https://github.com/NixOS/branding/releases/tag/nixos-branding-guide-v0.1.0/).
  (What threats are there to one of the world's largest Linux package ecosystems)?

## Ideas

Nix aims to provide secure, private access to self-hosted software everywhere,
while rethinking how we build and distribute it. As you attend DEF CON this
year, maybe Nix Vegas will inspire you with some ideas about how to rebuild _your_ self-hosted world
with [reproducible builds](https://reproducible.nixos.org/) and repeatedly deployable software:

- How can the world of nixpkgs become more usable for everyone?
- Can we provide connectivity to services built with Nix, as well as access to
  binary caches everywhere?
- What does Nix need to be the most secure system for software supply chain
  management in the world, and what are the threats to it?

We're excited to see everyone this year at DEF CON.

<3,
The Nix Vegas Team
