I flew from Florida to California with Nix on an old laptop and only four days of flailing experience. I felt grossly under prepared, but after the talks and meeting brilliant people, I was hooked.\r\n \r\nToday, I'm building Nix infrastructure full-time and manage every device I own declaratively with tools like Clan.\r\n \r\nThis talk maps my route from 'what the hell is a derivation?' to contributing to Nix projects in 100 days. I'll share the exact learning path, struggles, and wins. As someone close enough to remember the pain but far enough to have some solutions, I'll crash-course some tough Nix concepts with live demos showing my real usage.\r\n \r\nFor beginners and the Nix-curious, this can be a great launch point for YOUR speed-run. Nix's learning curve is infamous, but with the right fundamentals and some problem framing, it doesn't have to be.",

We’ll explore how to declaratively wrap any systemd service, placing it in an isolated network namespace with its own mesh network client (e.g., Tailscale or Netbird). This approach makes services securely accessible on your mesh, fully firewalled from the host—no application changes required. Good fit for folks exploring declarative infrastructure and looking for practical ways to apply modern security patterns to their own servers.",

Deploying and maintaining lakehouse components like object storage, table formats, catalogs, and query engines remains complex, opaque, and often tied to cloud assumptions. This session explores how Nix and NixOS can be used to declaratively define and deploy a full, self-hosted lakehouse architecture. The stack includes MinIO AIStor for high-performance object storage, Apache Iceberg for open table formats, Nessie or Polaris for metadata, and query engines like Dremio or DuckDB. Topics include early design experiments, the benefits of reproducibility and portability, and current challenges around packaging, network policy, and secure deployment. The goal is to present an aspirational blueprint for building cloud-native data infrastructure that runs anywhere from source.",

              "description": "What if learning Nix was like a speed-run?\r\n \r\nA few months ago, I'd never touched Nix. Then my friend's brother told me about PlanetNix at Scale22x. I flew from Florida to California with Nix on an old laptop and only four days of flailing experience. I felt grossly under prepared, but after the talks and meeting brilliant people, I was hooked.\r\n \r\nToday, I'm building Nix infrastructure full-time and manage every device I own declaratively with tools like Clan.\r\n \r\nThis talk maps my route from 'what the hell is a derivation?' to contributing to Nix projects in 100 days. I'll share the exact learning path, struggles, and wins. As someone close enough to remember the pain but far enough to have some solutions, I'll crash-course some tough Nix concepts with live demos showing my real usage.\r\n \r\nFor beginners and the Nix-curious, this can be a great launch point for YOUR speed-run. Nix's learning curve is infamous, but with the right fundamentals and some problem framing, it doesn't have to be.",

This approach makes services securely accessible on your mesh, fully firewalled from the host—no application changes required.

The stack includes MinIO AIStor for high-performance object storage, Apache Iceberg for open table formats, Nessie or Polaris for metadata, and query engines like Dremio or DuckDB. Topics include early design experiments, the benefits of reproducibility and portability, and current challenges around packaging, network policy, and secure deployment. The goal is to present an aspirational blueprint for building cloud-native data infrastructure that runs anywhere from source.",

How do you scale your reproducible setup across a team, startup, or organization?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll share my path from managing a personal NixOS homelab to architecting infrastructure and developer environments for a growing startup. After many false starts and tangled configurations, I found Clan—a powerful framework that transformed how I manage machines, roles, and secrets. With Clan, I've replaced fragmented manual processes with a single source of truth for all my deployments, cutting through the clutter and reclaiming hours of maintenance time.\r\n\r\nWe’ll look at how Clan makes it easy to keep your infrastructure organized, share reusable configuration modules, handle secrets securely with Clan Vars, and scale NixOS across teams without having to start from scratch each time.",

The talk explores the challenge of tackling numerous CTF problems with limited time and shows how the combination of Nix and AI offers a powerful workflow for solving CTFs that often require multiple, isolated testing environments.\r\n\r\nFinally, this custom Nix-based setup is compared to more traditional security-focused distros like Kali and AthenaOS. The talk ends by exploring how this approach transfers to real-world offensive security scenarios—pen testing, red teaming, and bug bounty hunting—and how much of it can be practically applied.",

              "description": "In this talk, the speaker walks through how they used Nix to declare several AI models with full access to their computer in order to climb the Hack The Box (HtB) leaderboard—after being previously hardstuck at the \"Hacker\" rank while juggling the responsibilities of being a busy dad.\r\n\r\nThey demonstrate a semi-autonomous workflow where they are (not) automating themselves out of a job. The talk explores the challenge of tackling numerous CTF problems with limited time and shows how the combination of Nix and AI offers a powerful workflow for solving CTFs that often require multiple, isolated testing environments.\r\n\r\nFinally, this custom Nix-based setup is compared to more traditional security-focused distros like Kali and AthenaOS. The talk ends by exploring how this approach transfers to real-world offensive security scenarios—pen testing, red teaming, and bug bounty hunting—and how much of it can be practically applied.",
